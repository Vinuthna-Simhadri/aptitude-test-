## h2 3.In a cricket team, the average age of eleven players in 28 years. What is the age of the captain?
### h3 I.The captain is eleven years older than the youngest player.
### h3 II.The average age of 10 players, other than the captain is 27.3 years.
### h3 III. Leaving aside the captain and the youngest player, the average ages of three groups of three players each are 25 years, 28 years and 30 years respectively.
## h2 A.Any two of the three
## h2 B.All I, II and III	
## h2 C.II only or I and III only
## h2 D.II and III only
## h2 E.None of these
## h2 Correct Answer: Option C
## h2 Explanation:
### h3 Total age of 11 players = (28 x 11) years = 308 years.
### h3  I. C = Y + 11      C - Y = 11 .... (i)
### h3 II. Total age of 10 players (excluding captain) = (27.3 x 10) years = 273 years.
### h3  Age of captain = (308 - 273) years = 35 years.
### h3 Thus, C = 35. .... (ii)
### h3 From (i) and (ii), we get Y = 24
### h3 III. Total age of 9 players = [ (25 x 3) + (28 x 3) + (30 x 3)] years = 249 years.
### h3 C + Y = (308 - 249) = 59 .... (iii)
