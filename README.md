##  3.In a cricket team, the average age of eleven players in 28 years. What is the age of the captain?
### I.The captain is eleven years older than the youngest player.
### II.The average age of 10 players, other than the captain is 27.3 years.
### III. Leaving aside the captain and the youngest player, the average ages of three groups of three players each are 25 years, 28 years and 30 years respectively.
##  A.Any two of the three
##  B.All I, II and III	
##  C.II only or I and III only
##  D.II and III only
##  E.None of these
##  Correct Answer: Option C
##  Explanation:
###  Total age of 11 players = (28 x 11) years = 308 years.
###   I. C = Y + 11      C - Y = 11 .... (i)
###  II. Total age of 10 players (excluding captain) = (27.3 x 10) years = 273 years.
###   Age of captain = (308 - 273) years = 35 years.
###  Thus, C = 35. .... (ii)
###  From (i) and (ii), we get Y = 24
###  III. Total age of 9 players = [ (25 x 3) + (28 x 3) + (30 x 3)] years = 249 years.
###  C + Y = (308 - 249) = 59 .... (iii)
###  From (i) and (iii), we get C = 35.

##  4.In a two-digit, if it is known that its unit's digit exceeds its ten's digit by 2 and that the product of the given number and the sum of its digits is equal to 144, then the number is:
### 	A.	24	
###  	B.	26
###  	C.	42
### 	D.	46
## Correct Answer: Option A
##  Explanation:
###  Let the ten's digit be x.
###  Then, unit's digit = x + 2.
###  Number = 10x + (x + 2) = 11x + 2.
###  Sum of digits = x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2.
###  (11x + 2)(2x + 2) = 144
###   22x^2+ 26x - 140 = 0
###   11x^2+ 13x - 70 = 0
###  (x - 2)(11x + 35) = 0
##    x = 2.
###  Hence, required number = 11x + 2 = 24.
