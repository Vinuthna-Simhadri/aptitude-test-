1.	In a regular week, there are 5 working days and for each day, the working hours are 8. A man gets Rs. 2.40 per hour for regular work and Rs. 3.20 per hours for overtime. If he earns Rs. 432 in 4 weeks, then how many hours does he work for ?
	A.	160	
	B.	175
	C.	180
	D.	195
Correct Answer: Option B
Explanation:
Suppose the man works overtime for x hours.
Now, working hours in 4 weeks = (5 x 8 x 4) = 160.
160 x 2.40 + x x 3.20 = 432
 3.20x = 432 - 384 = 48
 x = 15.
Hence, total hours of work = (160 + 15) = 175.

Direction (for Q.No. 3):
Each of the questions given below consists of a question followed by three statements. You have to study the question and the statements and decide which of the statement(s) is/are necessary to answer the question.

3.In a cricket team, the average age of eleven players in 28 years. What is the age of the captain?
I.The captain is eleven years older than the youngest player.
II.The average age of 10 players, other than the captain is 27.3 years.
III. Leaving aside the captain and the youngest player, the average ages of three groups of three players each are 25 years, 28 years and 30 years respectively.
A.Any two of the three
B.	All I, II and III	
C.	II only or I and III only
D.	II and III only
E.	None of these
Correct Answer: Option C
Explanation:
Total age of 11 players = (28 x 11) years = 308 years.
 I. C = Y + 11      C - Y = 11 .... (i)
II. Total age of 10 players (excluding captain) = (27.3 x 10) years = 273 years.
 Age of captain = (308 - 273) years = 35 years.
Thus, C = 35. .... (ii)
From (i) and (ii), we get Y = 24
III. Total age of 9 players = [ (25 x 3) + (28 x 3) + (30 x 3)] years = 249 years.
C + Y = (308 - 249) = 59 .... (iii)
From (i) and (iii), we get C = 35.
Thus, II alone gives the answer.
Also, I and III together give the answer.
 Correct answer is (C).

4.	In a two-digit, if it is known that its unit's digit exceeds its ten's digit by 2 and that the product of the given number and the sum of its digits is equal to 144, then the number is:
	A.	24	
	B.	26
	C.	42
	D.	46
Correct Answer: Option A
Explanation:
Let the ten's digit be x.
Then, unit's digit = x + 2.
Number = 10x + (x + 2) = 11x + 2.
Sum of digits = x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2.
 (11x + 2)(2x + 2) = 144
 22x^2+ 26x - 140 = 0
 11x^2+ 13x - 70 = 0
 (x - 2)(11x + 35) = 0
 x = 2.
Hence, required number = 11x + 2 = 24.

5.	Find a positive number which when increased by 17 is equal to 60 times the reciprocal of the number.
	A.	3
	B.	10	
	C.	17
	D.	20
Correct Answer: Option A
Explanation:
Let the number be x.
Then, x + 17 =	60/x
 x^2 + 17x - 60 = 0
 (x + 20)(x - 3) = 0
 x = 3

	C.	6 years
	D.	8 years
Correct Answer: Option C
Explanation:
Mother's age when Ayesha's brother was born = 36 years.
Father's age when Ayesha's brother was born = (38 + 4) years = 42 years.
Required difference = (42 - 36) years = 6 years.

III. Rahul is 5 years older than Tanya.
	A.	I and II only
	B.	II and III only
	C.	I and III only	
	D.	All I, II and III
	E.	Any two of the three
Correct Answer: Option E
Explanation:
  I. Let the present ages of Tanya and Rahul be 3x years and 4x years.
 II. After 5 years, (Tanya's age) : (Rahul's age) = 4 : 5.
III. (Rahul's age) = (Tanya's age) + 5.

From I and II, we get	3x+5/4x+5=4/5	. This gives x.
 Tanya's age = 3x can be found. Thus, I and II give the answer.

From I and III, we get 4x = 3x + 5. This gives x.
 Tanya's age = 3x can be found. Thus, I and III give the answer.

From III : Let Tanya's present age be t years.
Then Rahul's present age = (t + 5) years.

Thus, from II and III, we get :	t/t+5	=	4/5. This gives t.
Thus, II and III give the answer.
 Correct answer is (E)
